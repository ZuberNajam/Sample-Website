        <p>Having worked in the pharmaceutical and healthcare fields over the last 7 years, I cannot help but notice how reluctant some people in these two fields are to embrace artificial intelligence (AI). I find this to be a great tragedy because both the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries will benefit greatly once they embrace the AI revolution. As I mentioned in my previous article where I reviewed The Master Algorithm by Pedro Domingos, modern businesses will need to either embrace AI or risk going out of business. I wholeheartedly believe this to be true for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries as well. The reluctance to embrace AI in sectors where patients are involved stems from both the outlandish expectations that some have set for AI as well as the fear that has taken root by imagining a fictional future where AI make life-altering decisions while healthcare providers watch idly. Both concerns stem from a misrepresentation of AI and result in a travesty of what AI can do to improve the outcome of healthcare. </p>
        <p>In order to educate myself further about AI in healthcare, I spent time over the last couple of weeks reading Dr. Eric Topol’s book, Deep Medicine. Having thoroughly enjoyed the book, I decided that I wanted to take some time to write an article that focuses on just some of the things that I learned from the book. I will first discuss how AI can help with drug efficacy. The United States spends an increasing amount of money on pharmaceuticals every year and yet research has shown that most patients are not receiving the therapeutic value that we would expect. Next, I will discuss how AI can step in and immediately support the work of what Dr. Topol refers to as “doctors with patterns”. Doctors with patterns are clinicians who spend vast amounts of time recognizing patterns within images. The medical specialties that fall under this label are radiology, pathology, and dermatology. It is these specialties that can most immediately benefit from the presence of AI and for that reason, I believe that any discussion about alleviating the fears that the public has about AI in healthcare can find a natural starting point here. Dr. Topol has written a wonderful book which goes in depth explaining topics such as the history of AI, the ethics of AI in healthcare, the role of AI in diets, etc. In fact, I recommend that everyone interested in AI and/or healthcare pick up a copy of Deep Medicine and read it cover to cover for themselves. The goal that I hope to achieve by focusing on drug efficacy and doctors with patterns in this article is to get a discussion started. I would like to convince readers that AI will make the lives of both doctors and their patients better. It is no longer a matter of if but rather a matter of when we are willing to accept the inevitable when it comes to AI. Healthcare providers are expected to do too many tasks that we can automate. Automation is what computers do best. When we allow computers to do what they do best, we also allow our healthcare providers to do what they do best, and that is take care of their patients. Now before we get into the details of how AI can help us, let me first set the record straight on what we talk about when we talk about AI.</p>
        <p>There are two broad categories of AI. There is the narrow AI which constitutes pretty much all of AI that is being worked on today. These AI are fantastic at one specific thing that they have been taught to do. Within this category we find the likes of IBM Watson and AlphaGo Zero. For those new to the AI arena, IBM Watson is an AI that has successfully beat human contenders on Jeopardy. It is considered narrow AI because it searches Wikipedia for answers and by doing so, it excels at Jeopardy which has a lot of the knowledge content it pulls from available on Wikipedia. If IBM Watson was forced to play Monopoly, it wouldn’t seem so intelligent.  Similarly, AlphaGo Zero is narrow AI in the sense that it has mastered the Chinese game of Go and it had successfully defeated the best Go players in the world. If AlphaGo Zero was forced to play a child at Chess, it wouldn’t know where to begin. When we refer to AI in medicine, we are referring to narrow AI. The other category of AI is general AI. This is the type of AI that we are exposed to in Hollywood films and pop culture. Fans of sci-fi might remember examples of general AI such as the T-800 from The Terminator or VIKI from I, Robot. In both cases the AI surpass their programming and come to “understand” that humans can not be trusted with their own survival. The human imagination along with a truly science fictional understanding of general AI makes for great cinema. However, it does great harm in promoting the use of AI to solve major problems that exist in the world today. We are years to decades away from truly having general AI. When that time comes, we can deal with the ethical and existential questions that arise. In the meantime, narrow AI can help us solve problems that need solving today. Now, let’s look at what problems need solving and how AI can help.</p>
        <p>In 2015, the United States spent $320 billion on prescription drugs. By 2021, that cost is expected to rise to $600 billion. Despite skyrocketing expenditures, research done by Scripps Research has shown that 75% of patients that take one or more of the top 10 drugs by gross sale (2014) do not achieve the desired or expected benefit. For some prescription drugs like the heartburn medication Nexium (esomeprazole), 1 out of 25 patients taking the medication will achieve the desired or expected benefit from usage. Now granted, this is an extreme example. But when we look at the list, we see that the drugs with the highest efficacy (Humira, Remicade, and Enbrel) are expected to achieve the desired or expected results in just 1 out of 4 patients. This is quite bizarre. In any other industry we wouldn’t ever consider it ethical for consumers to pay for a product that only works 1 out of 4 times. And yet, this seems to be exactly what we are promoting in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
        <p>The underlying issue here is not necessarily that these medications do not work. Rather, the issue is that physicians have not been able to develop the skills needed to determine which type of patient will benefit from which type of drug. It is becoming more evident that the effectiveness of medications is determined to some extent by a person’s genetics. This means that determining the efficacy of a medication for an individual will require the study and analysis of colossal datasets of genetic information. This is where AI and machine learning can come in and help. It is irrational for us to expect that doctors memorize the specific genetic makeup of every patient that they see. The genetic data of patients, along with data regarding drug efficacy will combine to form huge amounts of unfiltered data. Fortunately for us, the bigger and rawer the dataset, the better use of it an AI system can make. First, the data will be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Then the algorithm will process the raw data and evaluate which of the hundreds to thousands of genes in the human genome correlate with different levels of drug efficacies. Finally, the algorithm will spit out as output the genes that clinicians need to consider when make recommendations for different patients. In time and with enough data provided for the algorithms to learn from, AI models could potentially provide information about drug efficacy in minutes from a patient’s blood sample.</p>
        <p>In addition to assisting in drug recommendations, AI also has a clear place amongst radiologists. Radiology is all about pattern recognition within images. Radiologists study thousands of CT, PET, nuclear, and MRI scans a year and are expected to identify abnormalities based on rules of identification that they have learned. Unfortunately, mistakes are made by even the best of doctors and it is well documented that radiologists can suffer from inattentional blindness whereby they become so focused on looking for specific things that they miss unexpected patterns or data that is right in front of them. Some studies suggest that errors in interpretation of medical scans could sit at 2% for false positive rate and 25% for the false positive rate. AI can help change that by allowing a network built for image recognition to be trained on any one of the scans that radiologists use. With the availability of hundreds of thousands and even millions of examples, an AI algorithm using deep learning could be taught to classify scans accurately and at the speed that only a computer can. In a matter of years, deep learning is expected to become more proficient at interpreting scans than radiologists. Michael Recht and Nick Bryan, writing in the Journal of the American College of Radiology summarize the future of the radiologist and AI partnership perfectly when they say “We believe that machine learning and AI will enhance both the value and the professional satisfaction of radiologists by allowing us to spend more time performing functions that add value and influence patient care and less time doing rote tasks that we neither enjoy nor perform as well as machines”. Ultimately, AI is not going to replace radiologists but rather AI is going to form a partnership with radiologists.</p>
        <p>Just as radiology is all about pattern recognition within images, pathology is all about pattern recognition within slides. Studies have already been done that show that machine learning systems are on par if not ahead of pathologists when it comes to correctly classifying slide images. In 2016, a group at Stony Brook University in New York used a class of deep neural networks called a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify both brain and lung cancer slide images. The CNN accomplished an accuracy level of 70% to 85% which was comparable to that of a group of community pathologists. The gold standard of AI, Google was able to do get even better results when it used a high-resolution algorithm to detect metastasis with accuracy better than 92%. When a group of pathologists classified the same slides under no time constraints, they achieved an accuracy rate of 73%. One need not be a math genius to see that the statistical difference present here is significant. There is a caveat though as the higher accuracy rates of the Google algorithm came with a higher false positive rate than was seen with the radiologists. Naturally, there are still some kinks that need to be worked out. However, the benefits of an AI system supporting pathologists is promising.</p>
        <p>Now we come to dermatology, the field of medicine that focuses on pattern recognition on the skin. Dermatology is an important specialty to consider as 15% of all doctor visits are for skin conditions. However, unlike the previous two fields of medicine that we just discussed where masters of the specialty were carrying out the pattern recognition; skin conditions are predominantly diagnosed by non-dermatologists. Because of this, error rates in diagnosis have been sighted as high as 50%. With the number of dermatologists working in the US being very limited, AI can have a huge impact by stepping in and helping non-dermatologists classify patterns of skin lesions correctly and quickly. The principal goal of AI in dermatology is to correctly identify skin cancer. A reason for this is that early detection of skin cancer/melanoma translates to a far better prognosis with a five-year survival rate of 99% vs a five-year survival rate of 14% if detected in late stages. Fortunately, dermatologists utilize a method to diagnose melanoma which is a perfect candidate for automation. An acronym known as ABCDE explains the pattern recognition used to diagnose melanoma. It stands for asymmetry, irregular border, more than one or uneven distribution of color, a large diameter, and evidence that the mole is evolving. When dermatologists are making diagnosis, they look at the patient’s skin and they also rely heavily on biopsies. The big question was whether deep learning algorithms could be used to simulate accurate classification from photographs of skin lesions taken at variable distances and angles. In 2017 we got our answer when a group at Stanford University trained a Google CNN algorithm (GoogleNet Inception v3) on 129,450 images of skin lesions. This initial training was followed by definitive validation done with biopsy-based diagnosis on 1,942 lesions. This resulted in a yes/no classification of whether (a) the image showed cancer, and if so, (b) was it malignant. The results produced by the algorithm were compared to the results of 20 board certified dermatologists and the Google algorithm outperformed each dermatologist in classifying cancer and performed better than average at identifying melanomas. Certainly, there is clinical validation that needs to be done before a CNN algorithm is introduced for common use. Nevertheless, we see from this example that when we allow AI to take an active role in pattern recognition of skin lesions, there is a potential for doctors to more accurately diagnose patients and save lives in the process.</p>
        <p>We have looked at several examples that show us how much healthcare can improve with the assistance of AI. To build on what I mentioned earlier in this article, it is not a matter of if AI can take root in healthcare but rather a question of when AI takes root in healthcare. In this review of Dr. Topol’s book, I merely scratched the surface regarding AI’s place in healthcare. I hope that by sharing some of the most evident applications of AI in healthcare, I can encourage people to continually learn more about AI and its applications. I plan on writing a follow-up to this article where I look at the AI applications as they relate to “doctors without patterns”. I think that would be a nice follow-up and it should reassure people that narrow AI will become deeply ingrained in medicine in the years to come.</p>
