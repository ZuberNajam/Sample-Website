         <p>Starting something new is exciting. It allows you to imagine the endless possibilities that your something new will open up for you. You can have a clean slate, and with that, the opportunity to redefine yourself and slip away from the labels of your past. Along with this excitement though there is also going to be a bit of <em>rational</em> fear. You will have questions like how do I start learning something new? With no prior experience, will the old tactics that helped me succeed in my previous endeavors still be useful? Also it OK to ask for help? And if it is OK, who should I ask? All of these questions are a normal part of transitioning to a new skill, especially when you decide to learn something that you have zero experience with. I personally had these questions running through my head when I changed my career path from medicine to software engineering. All of my experience up to that moment in my life, both educational and professional, had been in the health care field. All of my professional contacts were either medical doctors from the hospitals that I volunteered at or they were philosophical doctors from my university classes. My resume consisted of three different jobs, working as an EMT, working as a pharmacy technician, and working as a science and math tutor. All of the choice that I had made in the past were meant to set me up with a lucrative career as a doctor. Nevertheless, having finally made it to medical school, I figured out that the path through medical school was not one that I could continue on any longer. So I made my decision and realized that I had the change to start out fresh with something new.  After juggling a few professions through my head, I decided to use this opportunity to pursue something that I had always wanted to learn but had never made time for in the past. I had been given the opportunity to finally learn coding and become a producer in the world of consumption.</p>
        <p>Now I will be honest, the early days of my coding experience were difficult. It was February 2017 and the new year fervor was just still present. I decided to take advantage of the motivation and enthusiasm that the time of year brought with it and chose the self-learning route to programming. Like most people, I started out by learning HTML and CSS from an on-line website. It started out relatively simple with HTML tags and adding CSS style-sheets to decorate content. This early excitement was important because things did not stay easy for long. As I moved from HTML to CSS and ultimately to JavaScript, I started running into concepts and syntax errors that I struggled to make sense of. By trying to learn JavaScript completely on my own, I realized how important it was to be around other programmers who could help me understand the errors I was running into and who could give me feedback on the areas where I needed to grow as a programmer. So by the summer semester, I had decided to enroll in some undergraduate math and engineering courses at a nearby university. I met with a counselor in the college of engineering and computer science and they recommended that the most logical course of study for a student like me was to take the prerequisite courses for the masters program in computer science. I had enjoyed undergrad and most of my biology and chemistry courses had come relatively easy to me. I kind of overlooked the fact that I had received a strong foundation in the biological and physical sciences while in high school where I had taken 7 science credits with 2 of them being in AP biology and AP chemistry. This time around though, I was literally a <em>newbie</em> in my chosen field with my only experience being what I had self-taught myself over the last few months of building small scale websites on a text editor. Now I bring this up because at the time, I didn’t really understand what I was getting myself into. I figured that I would learn a little bit about a programming language and land myself an entry level job. My impression was that the requirements for an entry level job was knowing the raw basics. I did not realize that to get an entry level job in programming, I would need to invest roughly around 1 to 2 years programming before I was deemed “entry level”. And the best part is, I thought that understanding the basics of a couple markup languages like HTML and CSS would put me ahead of the game when I started learning a <em>real</em> programming language like C.  Needless to say, programming in the C language in my Introduction to programming class was not really anything like HTML or CSS. It started out simple enough with a "Hello World" program followed by the introduction of variables and functions. I think that the basics of JavaScript that I was able to teach myself gave me a false sense of confidence when the first couple programming assignments came naturally to me. Ironically enough, this early confidence really led me to getting caught off guard when our Professor introduced us to pointers, the crème de la crème of real programming. Now pointers are a <strong>very</strong> important concept in Programming. So I understood that to be a good programmer, I had to understand what pointers were and why they were so important in programming.  As with all things worth learning though, implementing pointers for the first time was one the more difficult tasks that I have had to deal with.</p>
        <p>As always though, you just have to push through the difficult stuff. After a few weeks of struggling with pointers, the rest of the semester became conceptually easier. Arrays took a bit of time for me to adjust to but that was because of arrays required the prerequisite knowledge of pointers. In short, arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same data type in memory. The array pointer points to the first item in the array and allows you to access other items by using the initial pointer as a reference. Understanding arrays is key since it gives us a good foundation for understanding data structures which appear later on in the computer science curriculum. Moving past arrays, the concepts of structs was a far simpler concept. Often shortened to "structs", structures allow you to store different data types in one place. So for instance, we could have a struct named inventory that stores the name of an item as a string, stores its cost as a double or float, and stores the quantity available in stock as an int. I enjoyed learning about structs because it finally brought the simpler programming concepts  together. Also, it laid the framework for classes in C++ which are the foundations of object oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a <strong>crucial</strong> concept to understand and so it is one that I will come back to at a later time(stay tuned).</p>
        <p>Structures pretty much brought my first programming course to an end. At the conclusion of my programming course,  I looked back with invaluable insight about learning to program. I learned that as convenient as self-learning is, it can hinder your growth if you don't already have the foundations laid down in a field like computer science. I found programming to be more demanding than my previous major. I needed to rely on my professors and fellow students for help more often than I was accustomed to. This was logical though as programming involves a lot of conceptualizing and the ultimate goal of programming is implementation. Implementation meant that we had to use the knowledge we gained to produce a program that had to run on a computer that was unforgiving to carelessness and mistakes. Granted, sometimes I felt that the programming assignments we were given were not true representations of the type of projects that would be expected by an employer. However, I do believe that they were important in getting us to practice the concepts that would ultimately matter in the industry. This is in sharp contrast to my experience as a biology major where I felt that the focus was on reading a textbook and spitting out that information on test day. Aside from my organic chemistry courses, I rarely relied on my professors for help and sometimes class would become a place to catch up on sleep. I knew what was expected of me in the cell biology lecture hall but I couldn’t tell you how I would implement what I learned their at a job. I mention this simply because learning to program taught me a lot about learning a new skill and how to implement it. I can say with certainty that every program that I create helps me get closer to me ultimate goal of being a software engineer. Now I cannot say that taking programming courses at a university is the right choice for everyone. I have heard from people who I consider reliable that the best way to get a job in programming is to invest in a coding boot-camp. I get that, I mean the best way to learn coding is definitely to completely immerse yourself in programming while having an instructor guide you. However, if you are like me trying to juggle work, family life, and an education… then a boot-camp might be too large of an investment in terms of time and money. For me, taking a couple of programming and engineering courses a semester has really helped me maintain the balance I need while allowing me to make progress towards my goal of becoming a software engineer.</p>
        <p>I hope that this article has been helpful. I know that a lot of people are looking to break into the software industry and it is not always clear what needs to be done. Not everyone will have the same questions and concerns that I did when starting out but hopefully this article can shed some light on what I did and what has helped me make progress. If this article did indeed help you, please stay tuned as I am hoping to produce more content on a regular basis. Until that time, good luck and happy coding!</p>
