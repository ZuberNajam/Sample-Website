         <!--<p>Programming a computer and manually preparing medications for a patient hardly seem like they go hand in hand. Truth be told though, my skillset as an aspiring software engineer has been enhanced by the experience that I have gained from working in a retail pharmacy. This is because the workplace has helped me develop softskills   been the inspiration for many of the projects that I plan on pursuing, knowing that they can have a direct impact on patient care. It is far easier to conceive an idea for a project when you can understand the problem to be solved. As a pharmacy technician, I am always amazed by how large corporate software can be so well attuned that I can fill a prescription in Fort Lauderdale, FL for a visiting tourist by transferring his prescription over electronically form his local branch of our pharmacy at Puerto Rico. It is convenient for the patient and it helps us as representatives of the healthcare profession to provide a higher level of patient care. However, as a student of computer science and programming, I often find myself wondering how I would approach the logic and design behind the software if I was responsible for creating and maintaining it. Maybe being the epitome of nerdom, I have found that many matter of fact conversations that I have had with co-workers quickly become homework assignments for me to go home and create a program to make the lives of both our patients and our own easier. I like to believe that the university is where I get ready to take off the training wheels and the workplace is what actually allows me to take them off.</p>
         <p>My average day at my workplace usually involves me typing in prescriptions for our patients</p>-->
