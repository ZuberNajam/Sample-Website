        <p>Today I am going to discuss the content of the first couple chapters of Pedro Domingos’ book “The Master Algorithm”. This book focuses deeply on machine learning algorithms, also called learners, and presents an argument that there is a one size fits all type of “Master” algorithm out there waiting to be discovered. In this article, I will start out by providing a brief introduction to what algorithms are and they are important. Then I will discuss the arguments that Domingos provides in support of the existence of a master theorem. Finally, I will discuss the different schools of though that currently exist within the machine learning community and how each paves a part of the path towards a wholesome solution.</p>
        <p>It all starts with algorithms. Computers have billions of switches, called transistors, that turn on and off in an almost unimaginable number of pairings. In order to turn these tiny switches on and off, computers need something to provide a sequence of precise steps of instruction. This is where algorithms come in. Algorithms provide a precious and unambiguous set of instructions to the computer whereby they control the on/off position of billions of transistors. This creates a virtually endless quantity of combinations and brings into existence the multi-purpose computer capable of running a multitude of different applications ranging from mathematical calculations to audio recording.</p>
        <p>With a computer and the right algorithm, it seems that anything is possible. However, there are three major problems that need to be addresses. For one, computers have a finite amount of memory. If an algorithm requires the use of more memory than a computer has available to it, then the algorithm is useless. Secondly, some algorithms are more complex than others and require us to wait long periods of time while they run. If the wait period is longer than we can afford wait, then the algorithm is also useless. Lastly, there is human complexity that we need to account for. When an algorithm becomes so complex that we cannot understand it, then it makes way for errors to creep in and makes maintenance impossible. An algorithm that goes on to create more trouble than it’s worth is also useless.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is a way to deal with these three problems and the resulting “complexity monster”. Through machine learning, it is possible to take in data and the desired results as input and output the algorithm that transforms our original data into the desired results. These learning algorithms, called learners, allow an algorithm to produce other algorithms. This is a fascinating use of computers ability to process information many times quicker than the human brain. And as more and more data become available to the computer, the better the algorithms that learners can create become. Computers have long been defined by the ability to learn any program that humans can write. Machine learning is now making it possible for computers to learn programs that humans cannot write. Today, a business with only developers competing with a business with developers and machine learning is comparable to an army with crossbows fighting against an army with machine guns. The army with crossbows is fighting a battle that it cannot win. Machine learning is becoming a tool that companies must either adopt or risk going out of business.</p>
        <p>The fascinating thing about machine learning is that the breadth of its applications is accomplished by the <strong>same</strong> few algorithms that have the capability of accomplishing many different things. Two of these algorithms are the Naïve Bayes and nearest-neighbor learning algorithms. Naïve-Bayes can learn to diagnose a medical condition or learn spam filters. The nearest-neighbor algorithm can learn to recognize handwriting, control robotic hands, or make movie recommendations. How can the same machine learning algorithm do many different things? They can by learning directly from the data that they are given. </p>
        <p>Since a few learners can be used for so many different applications, then is there a single learner that can do everything? To some extent, this depends on the data available. Given enough data, any learner can approximate any function closely. However, with a finite amount of data, learners need to make some assumptions. Different learners make different assumptions and therefore different learners are better at certain applications than others. However, it is Domingos’ belief that there is a universal learner that works for all applications, granted that sufficient data is available. Domingos calls the universal learner the “master algorithm. He believes that the discovery of the master algorithm will be the last great discovery that mankind will make. Once the master algorithm is discovered, it can be implemented to go on and create anything else that needs to be created.</p>
        <h3>The Five Arguments for the Master Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Domingos presents five different arguments for the master algorithm. He starts the discussion off with the first argument which is neuroscience. Studies have shown that the human and animal brain are capable of redundancy of function. A study was done at MIT where a ferret had the connections of its eyes rewired to its auditory cortex and the connections from its ears rerouted to its visual cortex. Despite this seemingly detrimental rewiring, the auditory cortex learned to see, and the visual cortex learned to hear. It turns out that this was possible because all the information in the brain is represented in the same form, via electrical impulses. Through long-term potentiation, connections are strengthened between neurons, thus allowing the brain to learn. This experiment exemplifies the most popular route to the Master Algorithm which is to reverse engineer the brain itself.</p>
        <p>The second argument presented is evolution. The mechanism supporting evolution is natural selection. Natural selection is very similar to what computer scientists call iterative search. Iterative search involves solving a problem by trying many different solutions, selecting and modifying the best ones, and then repeating those steps as needed. Natural selection does the same with living organisms, starting with a single-celled organism and working its way through the vast number of different multi-celled organisms that we see today. Within evolution, we see how much a simple learning algorithm can achieve if it is provided with the appropriate data. Evolution is another potential route to the master algorithm.</p>
        <p>The third argument stems from physics. Everything we experience in the physical world can be said to be a product of a few simple laws. This strengthens the argument that a single learner can induce all that there is to be induced. Just as the laws of physics percolate up to other domains such as biology and chemistry, the master theorem should be applicable in the same way for a vast domain of computer applications. Thus, by looking at physics, we find another route to the master algorithm.</p>
        <p>The fourth argument comes from statistics. Some statisticians will argue that a single formula makes all learning possible. This formula is known as the Bayes’ theorem. A Bayesian learner initiates with a set of hypotheses that are held to be true. As new pieces of data become available, the hypotheses that are more likely gain validity and the hypotheses that are less likely lose validity. Eventually, only a few dominant hypotheses remain which encapsulate the domain knowledge. Bayes’ theorem acts as a machine for converting data into knowledge and therefore is a potential route to the master algorithm.</p>
        <p>The fifth argument mentioned is the argument from computer science. As we discussed earlier, the computer makes it possible to solve every problem with a single device. A single device performing multiple functions is something that would have been unheard of in the past. The universal learner will accomplish the same thing as the computer. It will be a single algorithm capable of every application. It is hardly surprising that a route to the Master Theorem could come from computer science itself.</p>
        <h3>The Five Tribes of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>The five arguments we just discussed help us understand what we are looking for in the master algorithm. In the continued search for the master algorithm, there is a lot that needs to be understood about learning. Fortunately, Domingos shows us that the search for the master algorithm is not an endeavor that requires us to start from a blank slate. In fact, there are decades of research that we can pull from. Within machine learning, there are five schools of thought that can help us along the way to the master algorithm. The schools of thought and what we can learn from them is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Symbolists- You cannot learn from nothing. You need to have prior knowledge to make sense of the data. At its core, all knowledge is obtained by manipulating symbols as is done with a math equation. They hold inverse reduction as their master algorithm.</li>
          <li>Connectionists- Learning is made possible by the brain and therefore reverse engineering the brain is their solution. The brain learns by strengthening connections between neurons. Therefore, their master algorithm is backpropagation.</li>
          <li>Evolutionaries- All learning stems from natural selection. The problem they seek to solve is that of the learning structure in its entirety. Their master algorithm is genetic programming.</li>
          <li>Bayesians- All knowledge stems from uncertainty and depends on uncertain inferences. The problem that needs to be addressed is how to deal with the noise, missing data, or erroneous data without allowing the whole system to collapse. Their solution is probabilistic inference and in hand with this is their master algorithm, Bayes’ theorem.</li>
          <li>Analogizers- Learning is accomplished by recognizing similarities between situations and inferring other similarities. The problem to be addressed is how similar two things are. Their master algorithm is the support vector machine.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In this article, we have taken a brief look at the arguments in favor of a master theorem and have taken a look at the different schools of thought that exist within machine learning and provide us with some ideas, questions, and potential solutions to parts of the master algorithm puzzle. The reality that Domingos proposes is that the master algorithm is indeed a puzzle that needs to be solved piece by piece. One part of the solution will come from understanding the brain and another part of the solution will come from natural selection. The most important thing to keep in mind is that no single person will be responsible for discovering or creating the master algorithm. As with all great accomplishments that have preceded it, the master algorithm, if it is ever realized, will be the result of countless hours contributed by a countless number of people.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time for reading this article. I hope that it provided some insight into a topic within Artificial Intelligence that is very exciting. I plan on going deeper into the master algorithm and will add additional posts to share the things that I find interested.</p>
