        <p>I recently finished up Andrew Ng’s AI for Everyone course on Coursera. This was my first time taking a course on Coursera and going into it, I did not really know what to expect. I kind of thought that since the course was categorized under business strategy, it would not be technical enough for my liking. However, I knew going in that Andrew Ng is an expert in the field of AI and the thing about true experts is that they have a way of enlightening you through any platform. So, there was a good chance that I would find the course interesting regardless.</p>
        <p>The course was well structured and informative. It was organized into four modules scheduled over a 4-week period. At the end of each module was a quiz. The quiz was mandatory for anyone seeking a certification of completion. You can take the course free of charge as I did if you do not intend on getting the certification.</p>
        <p>I will go into detail to provide a summary of the most important bits of information that I picked up while taking the course. I highly recommend that anyone interested in AI take the course for themselves. You can access the course by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone">clicking here</a>. For those looking for the cliff notes version of the course, please read on.</p>

        <h3>Week 1</h3>

        <p>The first week is an introduction to the field of AI. Ng explains how artificial intelligence (AI) is largely driven by machine learning (ML) in particular, supervised learning which is the most common type of machine learning. Supervised learning takes an input (a) and turns it into an output (b). A couple examples of supervised learning are spam filtering and speech recognition. In spam filtering, the email is taken as input which comes in and the spam email is filtered out as output. Similarly, in speech recognition, audio input is processed, and the text transcript exits as output. The explosion of AI systems over the last few years has been made possible by the development of neural networks and big data which have increased the performance of AI systems.</p>
        <p>An important question that Ng brings up is how do we acquire data? Data can be acquired through multiple channels. It can be manually labeled. It can be gathered from observing behaviors. It can also be downloaded from websites or received through partnerships. Once data is acquired, Ng recommends that it should be fed into the AI system immediately. It is not a good practice to wait until you have large pools of data because you can get valuable feedback from the AI system by feeding it data early.</p>
        <p>Ng brings up another important question. What makes an AI company? This question is like the asking, what makes an internet company? Just because a shopping mall has a website, that doesn’t make it an internet company. Similarly, an AI company should have a few specific characteristics. There should be strategic data acquisition, a unified data warehouse, presence of pervasive automation, and new roles and a division of labor.</p>
        <p>Now that we are clear on what an AI company is, we look at the 5 steps of AI transformation.  Step 1 is to execute pilot projects to gain momentum. This step is important because it provides the positive reinforcement needed to follow through with the rest of the steps. Step 2 is building an in-house AI team. Once you have your in-house team in place, step 3 is to provide broad AI training. The amount of training that will need to be provided depends on the different roles of the employee(s). Step 4 is to develop an AI strategy. You don’t want to do this step earlier in the process because you want to carry out steps 1-3 first and get the foundation established. Step 5 is to develop internal and external communications. Your in-house AI team needs to be able to communicate effectively within the business and they might need to be in communication with external parties as well. Once the AI transformation is complete, the company can begin taking advantage of AI.</p>
        <p>Ng points out that a lot of businesses have unrealistic expectations of what AI can do and what AI cannot do. A good way of determining if AI can do something is to think about whether we as humans can something with 1 second of thought. If we can, then we can probably automate that task. If we can’t, then maybe we can’t automate it.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        
        <p>In week 2, Ng goes over the workflow of machine learning and data science projects. In a machine learning project, like speech recognition software, there are three steps. Step 1 is to collect data. Step 2 is to train the model. You will have to run data through the model many times until is gets good enough. Step 3 is to deploy the model. This will provide you with feedback which can then be applied to maintain or update the model. The workflow for a data science project is similar. For a project like optimizing a sales funnel, you follow the following three steps. Step 1 is to collect data. Step 2 is to analyze the data. You might have to go through the data many times to get good insights. Step 3 is to suggest hypothesis and/or actions to be taken. You will inevitably have to deploy changes and re-analyze the data periodically. These steps are important for practitioners to understand but since AI is something that will impact practically every industry. Ng recommends that people with every job function learn how to use data.</p>
        <p>After discussing the workflows, Ng discusses how to choose an AI project. Choosing an AI project requires AI experts and domain experts coming together and deciding what AI can do and how that can be used to provide value for the business. The AI team should focus on automating tasks rather than automating jobs and due diligence should be given to both the technical and business aspects. Can the AI system meet the desires performance? Will the project lead to decreased costs or increased revenue? These are all questions that need to be asked before moving forward with an AI project. Within the AI team, the acceptance criteria should be specified as well, and the team should be made aware that expecting 100% accuracy is not realistic.</p>
        <h3>Week 3</h3>
        <p>Ng starts out week 3 going over some case studies. The first case study looked at is the smart speaker. A user says to the smart speaker, “Hey device, tell me a joke”. The smart speaker follows a set of steps to process the command. Step 1 is detecting the trigger word / wake word. If the device is unable to detect the trigger word, it cannot continue to the next steps. Step 2 is speech recognition. The device needs to be able to understand what is being said. Step 3 is intent recognition. The device needs to understand what the purpose is of what the user is saying. Step 4 is to execute the joke. The device needs to deliver on what is being expected of it. </p>
        <p>The second case study looked at is self-driving cars. For a self-driving vehicle to drive, it follows certain steps. In step 1, it needs to get readings from its sensors for pedestrian detection. In step 2, it needs readings from the sensors for car detection. In step 3, the vehicle carries out motion planning whereby the steering, acceleration, and braking system are provided instruction in order to to accomplish the desired movement.</p>
        <p>After completing the case studies, we look at some of the roles on the AI teams. The general roles are shown in the table below.</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Role Title</th>
            <th>Tasks Performed</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>Software Engineer</th>
            <th>Software creation (e.g. joke execution, self-driving reliability…)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Machine Learning Engineer</th>
            <th>Creation of ML systems and programs</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>Applied ML Scientist</th>
            <th>Cross between ML engineer and ML researcher</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Machine Learning Engineer</th>
            <th>Extend state-of-the-art technology in ML</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>Data Scientist</th>
            <th>Examine data and provide insights</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Data Engineer</th>
            <th>Organize data, make sure data is secure</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>AI Product Manager</th>
            <th>Help decide what to build; what is feasible and valuable</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The most important thing than Ng stresses is the need to work with what you have. You might not have some or even most of the roles mentioned in Table 1 available to you. However, even if you are working by yourself, you can educate yourself and get started on small but meaningful projects.</p>
        <p>For those committed to AI, Ng goes on to share the AI Transformation Playbook in greater detail. We mentioned earlier the 5 steps for an AI transformation. The table below expands on those steps and paints a more vivid picture of what really happens during each step.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Functions</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>1. Execute pilot programs to gain momentum</th>
            <th>This is more important for the initial project to succeed rather than for it to be the most valuable. It should show traction within 6-12 months. This step can be in-house or outsourced</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>2. Build an in-house AI team </th>
            <th> AI function can be under CTO, CIO, CDO, or a new CAIO.</th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>3. Provide broad AI training</th>
            <th>The smart CLO knows they should curate rather than create content.</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>4. Develop an AI strategy</th>
            <th> Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector. Design a strategy aligned with the “Virtuous Cycle of AI” (More data ->better product -> more users). Consider creating a data strategy which includes strategic data acquisition and a unified data warehouse.Create network effects and platform advantages.
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <th>5. Develop internal and external communications</th>
            <th>Investor relations, government relations, consumer / user education, talent/recruitment, and internal communications </th>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>At this point, it is a good time for Ng to reiterate the pitfalls that overeager AI teams fall into. In order to avoid those pitfalls, <strong>don’t</strong> do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expect AI to solve everything.</li>
          <li>Hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases.</li>
          <li>Expect the AI project to work the first time.</li>
          <li>Expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes.</li>
          <li>Think that you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything worthwhile.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additionally, in order to avoid those pitfalls, <strong>do</strong> the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data and engineering resources.</li>
          <li>Pair engineering talent with business talent and work cross-functionally to find feasible and valuable projects.</li>
          <li>Work with AI team to establish timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ng finishes week 3 off with some advice on next steps that students can take. He recommends getting friends involved with learning AI so that they can stay motivated to learn within the structure of the group. Additionally, he recommends that people in a leadership role work towards hiring machine learning or data science experts to get things rolling. For employees of larger corporations, he recommends that they might want to start a discussion with the CEO or board of directors to see if an AI transformation would be valuable to them.</p>

        <h3>Week 4</h3>

        <p>As the course comes to an end, Ng makes sure that the student understands how AI impacts society and the world. He recommends the “Goldilocks rule for AI”. This rule advises us to not too be too optimistic about the capabilities of AI while at the same time, not being too pessimistic about AI. AI can’t do everything, but it will transform industries. As industries are being transformed, questions on ethics will come up. Some AI systems are known to learn unhealthy stereotypes. As people knowledgeable in AI, we will need to make sure that these issues are addressed. In some cases, this will involve more careful training of AI systems and the use of more inclusive data.</p>
        <p>AI could also be used by scammers and hackers for adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks on AI are defined as attacks that serve to alter the function of the AI system. As AI systems become more prevalent, effort and investments will need to be made to make sure that defenses are adequate to combat these attacks. This effort will need to take place on both local and global levels.</p>
        <p>The modern world is a global village and Ng goes above and beyond by outlining how countries will evolve to adapt AI. The US and China are currently leading the way in AI research. This does not mean that the rest of the world should just sit idly and watch. Ng believes that investments should be made in AI to strengthen a country’s vertical industries. The entirety of the global AI community is still immature and there is a lot of room for investment.</p>
        <p>Finally, Ng addresses the elephant in the room. Will AI hijack the jobs of hard-working Americans and take away their livelihood? The answer is no but there should be ongoing discussions on how technology can be incorporated for the betterment of society. While it is true that between 400 million to 800 million global jobs are expected to be displaced by 2030, the expectation is that 555 million to 890 million jobs will also be created by 2030. As always, some jobs will be made unnecessary and will go away. However, many new jobs will be available for people that are willing to embrace change and learn new skills. Some people probably don’t want to hear this. Ng has some recommendations that should resonate well with these people. With AI paving the way for automating many redundant tasks, it might be appropriate to think about a conditional basic income. This will provide a safety net for people and at the same time, it will include incentives for people to better themselves by learning skills essential for the evolving work force. AI will be a tool for us to use as we work towards a better society if we allow it to.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>By the end of this course, you will have learned what AI is, what projects utilize it, how to incorporate it into your company, and how it impacts society. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and I highly recommend it to everyone, regardless of whether they are interested in working directly with AI technology or not. Overall, the course was pretty light on the technical details but for the general student just trying to grasp the field of AI, it was perfect. Also, I should do this course justice and point out that it does include optional videos that go into greater technical detail and that more than rectified any concern I had going in that there would not be enough technical information presented. Although this has been my first Coursera course, I have taken multiple courses on Udemy and Treehouse before and I personally think that there is a lot of information available for curious students on each of these platforms. I plan on taking additional courses on Coursera to get a better feeling of the platform. I enjoyed this course specifically because it was taught by an expert in the field of AI. I honestly believe that I would enjoy learning from Andrew Ng on any platform.</p>
        <p>For those of you who made it this far, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that it was informative and that it encouraged you to take Andrew Ng’s course for yourself. I plan on producing more content over the weeks and months to come. My plan for the month of March is to write a summary review on The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World by Pedro Domingos. If you enjoyed this read, please stay tuned!</p>
