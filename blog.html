              <h3>Introduction to the Master Algorithm</h3>
              <p>By: Zuber Najam</p>
            </header>
            <p>Today I am going to discuss the content of the first couple chapters of Pedro Domingos’ book “The Master Algorithm”. This book focuses deeply on machine learning algorithms, also called learners, and presents an argument that there is a one size fits all type of “Master” algorithm out there waiting to be discovered. In this article, I will start out by providing a brief introduction to what algorithms are and they are important. Then I will discuss the arguments that Domingos provides in support of the existence of a master theorem. Finally, I will discuss the different schools of though that currently exist within the machine learning community and how each paves a part of the path towards a wholesome solution.</p>

              <h3>A Summary and Review of Andrew Ng's AI for Everyone</h3>
              <p>By: Zuber Najam</p>
            </header>
            <p>I recently finished up Andrew Ng’s AI for Everyone course on Coursera. This was my first time taking a course on Coursera and going into it, I did not really know what to expect. I kind of thought that since the course was categorized under business strategy, it would not be technical enough for my liking. However, I knew going in that Andrew Ng is an expert in the field of AI and the thing about true experts is that they have a way of enlightening you through any platform.</p>

              <h3>A Review of <em>How Smart Machines Think</em> by Sean Gerrish (The DARPA Challenge)</h3>
              <p>By: Zuber Najam</p>
            </header>
            <p>In his book, Gerrish does a great job of introducing the reader to several different automatons, or self-moving machines, of the early 20th century. The first of these automatons introduced, and the ones that I will address in this blog post are the smart cars that raced across the Mojave Desert in The DARPA Grand Challenge.</p>

              <h3>Experience of a Computer Science Student Working as a Pharmacy Technician</h3>
              <p>By: Zuber Najam</p>
            </header>
            <p><em>Programming a computer</em> and manually preparing medications for a patient hardly seem like they go hand in hand. My experience as an aspiring software engineer however has been enhanced by the experience that I have gained working in a retail pharmacy. This is because the workplace has been the inspiration for many of the projects that I plan on pursuing, knowing that they can have a direct impact on patient care.</p>
